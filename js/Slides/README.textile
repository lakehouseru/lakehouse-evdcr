h1. Slides, A Slideshow Plugin for jQuery

Slides is a crazy simple slideshow plugin for jQuery. With features like looping, auto play, fade or slide transition effects, crossfading, image preloading, and auto generated pagination.

With Slides you'll never see multiple slides fly by. Slides elegantly just slides from one slide to the next. Awesome.

Check out "http://slidesjs.com/":http://slidesjs.com/ for full instructions and examples.

Give it a try and if you have a question or find a bug <a href="http://github.com/nathansearles/slides/issues">hit me up</a> at GitHub or <a href="mailto:nsearles@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>..

Slides is compatible with all modern web browsers including; Internet Explorer 7/8/9, Firefox 3+, Chrome, Safari and Mobile Safari. And it'll even work in our old friend IE6.
